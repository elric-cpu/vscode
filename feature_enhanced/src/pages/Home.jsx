              than just a building—it’s your sanctuary. Whether you’re facing
              the sudden stress of water damage or planning a dream kitchen
              remodel, you need a partner you can trust. We are a locally owned
              and operated construction and restoration company dedicated to
              serving our neighbors in Harney County and the Mid-Willamette
              Valley.

              insured (CCB# 258533), giving you peace of mind that your property

              Our Commitment to Emergency Response
            </h2>
            <p className="mb-6">
              Disasters don’t wait for business hours, and neither do we. Water
              damage can escalate quickly, leading to structural issues and mold
              growth if not addressed immediately. That’s why Benson Home
              Solutions offers <strong>24/7 emergency response services</strong>
              .
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6">
              When you call us, you speak to a local professional ready to
              mobilize quickly to Burns, Hines, Sweet Home, Lebanon, or Albany.
              We arrive with the industrial-grade equipment needed to extract
              water, dry out your property, and secure your home against further
              damage. We also work directly with your insurance company to
              streamline the claims process, documenting every step to ensure
              you get the coverage you deserve.
